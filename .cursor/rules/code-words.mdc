## AI Assistant Code Words
  - When the user types "chrona sync", the assistant should:
    1. Find all changes in the project.
    2. Stage (git add) all changes.
    3. Generate a descriptive commit message.
    4. Commit and push to the current branch.
    5. Do this automatically, without asking for confirmation.
